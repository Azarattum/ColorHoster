```

## Getting Started

### Prebuilt Binaries
Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Azarattum/ColorHoster/releases) for your OS.

### Configuration
[JAO1988](https://github.com/JAO1988/) made [an excellent guide](https://github.com/JAO1988/ColorHoster-JSON/tree/main) on how to get ColorHoster running with your keyboard. [His repo](https://github.com/JAO1988/ColorHoster-JSON/tree/main/keyboards) also has a collection of prebuilt VIA JSON configurations for various keyboards.

For my personal setup you can take a look at my [QMK fork for Lemokey P1 HE](https://github.com/Azarattum/QMK) with ColorHoster support and other cool features (the repo also has [my VIA JSON config](https://github.com/Azarattum/QMK/blob/hall_effect_custom/keyboards/lemokey/p1_he/via_json/p1_he_ansi_v1.0.json)). For ColorHoster implementation there refer to [this commit](https://github.com/Azarattum/QMK/commit/b80ff1fdd85fe8d2eb7c604f02568b8adf5f949f).

### Running
```bash
./ColorHoster --brightness --json ./path/to/your_keyboard.json
```

## Client Integration

ColorHoster should be compatible with any OpenRGB v3 protocol client, enabling RGB control through various applications. Some example clients include:

- [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) (can be use as a client as well)
- [Project Aurora](https://www.project-aurora.com/) (may require renaming the binary to `OpenRGB.exe` to be detected)
- [Artemis RGB](https://artemis-rgb.com/)

### To Connect
1. Launch ColorHoster with your keyboard configuration
2. In your RGB control software:
   - Add a new OpenRGB SDK device
   - Set address to `127.0.0.1`
   - Set port to `6742` (default)
3. The client should automatically detect:
   - Keyboard LED layout
   - Available lighting modes
   - Real-time control capabilities

## Service Management (`--service` option)

ColorHoster can run as a background service on any OS using the `--service` option: `create`, `start`, `stop`, or `delete`. When you run `--service create` with any CLI options, those options are saved to a `colorhoster.toml` config file next to the executable and will become the default options for both service and CLI usage (unless overridden).

## Technical Details

VIA's RGB protocol doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, so it was reverse-engineered from  [the keyboard API in the VIA app](https://github.com/the-via/app/blob/80dd7453a2f0a53233cd2c5bcc526847feb17e0e/src/utils/keyboard-api.ts#L372-L384). The protocol in ColorHoster is also extended to support per-key brightness adjustments (originally it allowed to modify only hue and saturation).
